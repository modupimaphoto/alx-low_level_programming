# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

A hash function is a function that maps data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Hash functions and their associated hash tables are used in data storage and retrieval applications to access data in a small and nearly constant time per retrieval. They require an amount of storage space only fractionally greater than the total space required for the data or records themselves.
